Those class labels are discrete, unordered values that can be understood as the group memberships of the data points. The example of email spam detection represents a typical example of a binary classification task, where the machine learning algorithm learns a set of rules to distinguish between two possible classes: spam and non-spam emails. However, the set of class labels does not have to be of a binary nature. The predictive model learned by a supervised learning algorithm can assign any class label that was presented in the training dataset to a new, unlabeled data point or instance.\n",

We can collect a training dataset that consists of multiple handwritten examples of each letter in the alphabet. The letters (\"A\", \"B\", \"C\" and so on) will represent the different unordered categories or class labels that we want to predict. Now, if a user provides a new handwritten character via an input device, our predictive model will be able to predict the correct letter in the alphabet with certain accuracy. However, our machine learning system will be unable to correctly recognize any of the digits between 0 and 9, for example, if they were not part of the training dataset.\n",

If there is a relationship between the time spent studying for the test and the final scores, we could use it as training data to learn a model that uses the study time to predict the test scores of future students who are planning to take this test."

Then we put them in the field and asked them to find orange. It is supervised learning. But in case of Unsupervised learning, same group of students saw that with orange they have one more fruit in the field which is apple, even they don't know that but they will not combine those apples with oranges and if they plucked it they will make different group of that. Even they are not told that it is apple but still by seeing the shape, color, texture they were able to make different group. It is known as Unsupervised learning. \n",
